# Web Shop API

## Introduction

The Web Shop API is a Java-based backend solution developed using Spring Boot. It was created as a part of my exploration into web backend development, demonstrating key features of e-commerce APIs.

## Key Functionalities

- **Product Management:** CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for products.
- **User Management:** Handling user data, including registration, authentication, and profile management.
- **Order Processing:** Functionality to place, track, and manage orders.
- **Shopping Cart:** Implementing a shopping cart system that allows users to add or remove products and proceed to checkout.
- **Payment Integration:** Mock payment processing to emulate the e-commerce transaction experience.
- **Category Management:** Organize products into different categories for easier browsing and management.
- **Search & Filter:** Allows users to search for products and apply various filters.
- **Security:** Implementing basic security features for API endpoints.
- **Database Integration:** Utilizing a relational database for persisting application data.

## Technologies Used

- **Java:** The primary programming language used.
- **Spring Boot:** For creating the API framework.
- **Hibernate:** For object-relational mapping and database interaction.
- **JWT:** For secure user authentication.
- **SQL Database:** For data storage and management.

## Project Status

This project was a stepping stone in my journey as a developer. It's not currently maintained as my focus has shifted away from Java and Spring, but it remains a solid example of a Java-based web API for e-commerce.
